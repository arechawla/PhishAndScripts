# PhishingIdentifier
This is a project for the UGAHacks4, by Rahul Chawla and Keaton Sadoski. We are implementing a markov chain text classification algorithm to determine the likelyhood of potential phising threats via email.

The goal is to provide this information in a convenient manner via a chrome extension so the user can better protect themselves against online predators.
